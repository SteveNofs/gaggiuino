## NEXTION 4.3" DISPLAY, NEXTION 3.5" DISPLAY and NEXTION 2.4"/2.8" DISPLAY HMI FILES

by Steve Nofs
  - NOTE: Previous GitHub repository was deleted as it was not a proper fork of the original code. This GitHub repository resolves that issue and assures proper credit is given to Zer0-bit/Gaggiuino as the creator of the original source.
  - For those without the Nextion editor: All TFT files have been compiled/uploaded for 'standard' orientation and 'flipped 180' rotation. Let me know if you need a specific display compiled/uploaded.
  - The Nextion 4.3" must be Intelligent Series to run the 4.3" code.
  - This GitHub repository contains my HMI versions for the Nextion display for use on the Gaggiuino mod of the Gaggia Espresso Machine.
  - My goal was to provide a clean and innovative interface to the STM32 controller while maintaining all functionality of the original HMI coding.
  - The official project lives here: [Gaggiuino](https://gaggiuino.github.io/#/)
  - What you will find here are my HMI files and compiled TFT files for the 2.4"/2.8", 3.5" and 4.3" Nextion displays.
  - Feel free to give them a try. If for any reason you want to revert back to the original HMI code you can always flash the original code to your display.
  - Enjoy!
